# BFSS Matrix Model 

This is all the code and plots created in my research into Hybrid Monte Carlo Simulations of the discretised Bosonic BFSS model. I  delve into the application of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to the simulation of the bosonic BFSS matrix model. 

Starting with fundamental concepts,I develop algorithms that begin with simulating a simple harmonic oscillator and progress to addressing the complexities of the BFSS model, including SU(N) gauge freedom and fermionic fields. I outline the progression, from basic quantum harmonicoscillators in fixed gauges to incorporating Yang-Mills potentials and discrete gauge choices. The approach is validated through numerical experiments and comparisons to analytic expectation values. This work represents a proof of concept for using HMC methods to simulate the BFSS model.
